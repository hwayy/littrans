# Changelog

All notable distributed changes to LitTrans are recorded here. Versions follow semantic
versioning and correspond to Git tags named `v<version>`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Added a Cursor plugin manifest, marketplace catalog, and local writer/reviewer subagents so the
  same plugin tree installs on Cursor without changing the Codex marketplace path.
- Documented Codex and Cursor install, update, and local-only subagent rules.

### Changed

- Rewrote skill descriptions and host invocation wording so workflows are agent-neutral. Codex
  `$skill-name` prompts in `agents/openai.yaml` are unchanged.
- Cursor audit reviewers stay read-only and return JSONL for the parent to persist; consumer
  Cursor install clones into `littrans` before creating the local plugin junction.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Added compatibility with Antigravity CLI 1.1.12 success envelopes while preserving legacy
  direct structured-review results.
- Failed immediately on non-success Antigravity statuses and rejected missing, invalid, or
  unexpectedly extended structured outputs without weakening actual-model verification.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added schema-v4 page verification receipts, unit-level audit runs, workflow packet manifests,
  external-review usage metadata, and a lossless `project migrate --to 4` command.
- Added three-batch workflow selection and packet generation, review-set import, workflow metrics,
  exact multi-batch rendering, and the `continue-literature-translation` coordinator skill.

### Changed

- Made translation submission semantic: metadata-only or identical resubmissions no longer create
  revisions, history entries, status changes, or evidence invalidations.
- Reused unchanged page verification and audit evidence while invalidating changed units and their
  continuation, structured-region, adjacency, and seam dependencies precisely.
- Reduced large schema-v3 migration previews to one shared project snapshot and skipped expensive
  fingerprint reconstruction for manifests that contain no legacy evidence.
- Scoped model packets to relevant approved terms and at most six current approved translation
  memories, with adjacent examples preferred.
- Added full-to-incremental external review selection, Claude stdin prompt delivery with file-mode
  fallback, Antigravity JSON Schema output, and normalized duration/token/cost recording.
- Kept Claude stdin prompt delivery feature-gated off after the six-batch shadow A/B missed a
  seeded major technical defect. Production review continues to use file delivery; the other
  efficiency improvements are unaffected.

### Compatibility

- Preserved all v0.2 commands and project content. Schema-v3 projects require the documented
  one-time migration; no translation, issue, revision, or approval state is rewritten.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Merged list items that continue across PDF pages into one logical item in Markdown and
  bilingual HTML renders.
- Recorded external-review timeouts as failed review runs instead of losing the attempt history.
- Preserved sidebar context and joined sidebar body fragments across page boundaries.
- Normalized translated Chinese figure captions consistently during QA, external review, and
  rendering.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Established the private Git-backed `littrans` marketplace as the stable distribution source.
- Added controlled batch rendering and external review gates.
- Added structured support for tables, code, callouts, sidebars, reader notes, and cross-page
  continuations.
- Added repository-local validation and a documented manual release workflow.

### Changed

- Aligned the plugin manifest, Python package, and runtime package version at `0.2.1`.
- Separated the stable release identity from local Codex cachebuster versions.

### Fixed

- Preserved translation and rendering semantics across structured regions and page boundaries.
- Rejected placeholder external-review evidence and recovered source units nested in extracted
  tables.
